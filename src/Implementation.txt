- Use C++ (object construction) only in the set up 
- Use basically C in the repeated data transfer

- Set size of the standard input/output to zero (at the begining of the C-programs).

- in the main programs: catch errors which may be occurrs usage error
- in the libraries: catch other errors with output of error log, either terminate or continuing processing depending upon criticallity

- minimize number of memory copy
