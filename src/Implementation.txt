Dependency:

- c/c++
- rapidjson
- getopt
- make
- nc
- bash, cat, stdbuf, ...

Design Note:

- Use C++ (object construction) only in the set up 

- Use basically C in the repeated data transfer
  e.g. memcpy
- minimize number of memory copy

- some methods return status of execution
- in the libraries: error might be or might not be logged to stderr. 
  caller should terminate or continue processing depending upon criticallity
  four types of result
  - 0, -1           ... no error (-1 means end of input) 
  - ERROR_PARAM     ... error is not logged by the libraries, message should be handled by callers
  - ERROR_LOG_FATAL ... error is logged by the libraries, caller can be abort immidiately
  - ERROR_LOG_WARN  ... error is logged by the libraries, caller may continue processing 

- Set size of the standard input/output to zero (at the initialization of each input/output).

- To present a time in a scaler value, the type 'long double (=s3sim_time_t)' is required. Although 80 bits (intel type; significand 64bits) or 128 bits (IEEE quadruple-precision floating-point; significand 113bits) can preserve full information presented in a combination of coarse time (32bits) and nanoseconds (30bits), 64bits (IEEE double-precision floating-point; significand 52bits) can preserve time information only in the accuracy of microseconds.

Naming Convention
- xxxbuf, xxxlen       ... buffer and length of PCAP Packet Data
- xxxxx_buf, xxxxx_len ... buffer and length of PCAP Packet Record
